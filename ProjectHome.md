## Overview ##

Genetic conditions are increasingly important mediators of human disease. However, an informational bottleneck is growing because of the paucity of national and international disease registries. Single gene disorders account for approximately 10,000 human diseases, of which some 7,000 disorders are categorized as rare diseases. The restricted numbers of people affected with each of these diseases means that it is difficult to recruit sufficient numbers of patients to undertake clinical and translational research or clinical trials. Currently, the identification and treatment of single gene disorders is essentially conducted on an ad hoc basis, and for many conditions there are no data on prevalence or the numbers of patients requiring treatment. In the absence of fundamental disease information it is impossible to: i) assess the health and economic impact of single gene disorders; ii) devise viable disease management strategies; and iii) engage complementary national/international expertise. International registries provide opportunities for patients to be able to access new therapies through global clinical trials.

Leading-edge Internet-based platforms that specifically address essential security and privacy issues, and access to specialised in-house knowledge to enable interpretation from disease registries, are integral factors in solving these problems. The system architectures of currently available open source disease registries do not offer features such as mutiple-level access by a range of user groups such as clinicians, geneticists and molecular scientists. We present a new approach to the design of an Open Source Internet-based architecture for disease registries for patients with clinical and genetic data in geographical disparate locations.

The system has been successfully adopted as the Australian National Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (ANDMD) located at: http://www.nmdregistry.com.au/dmd/ and links into the international effort led by TREAT-NMD, a network based in the UK and Europe, which brings together patients and specialists working on treatments for neuromuscular (NMD) disorders. The framework is being utilised for a number of other rare diseases.

The DMD Registry is built on a modified version of the open source Django 1.3  framework. The DMD Registry is deployed on a standard Apache Web server running on Linux, with the database layer being provided by the PostgreSQL relational database server.
